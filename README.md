# LexNET: Integrated Path-based and Distributional Method for Lexical Semantic Relation Classification

**LexNET** is an open source framework for classifying semantic relations between term-pairs. It uses distributional information on each term, and path-based information, encoded using an LSTM.

**LexNET** participated in the CogALex-V Shared Task on the Corpus-Based Identification of Semantic Relations, and achieved the best performance among the competitors on subtask 2 (semantic relation classification). The following paper describes the submission:
